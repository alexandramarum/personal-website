            I'm Alexandra, a rising Senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science 
            and a B.A. in Philosophy. This summer, I will be working remotely as an iOS Software Engineer Intern for GameChanger by Dick's 
            Sporting Goods.

          <p>
            Over the past two years, I've cultivated a passion for iOS development as a member of UNC's App Team Carolina, 
            a student-run non-profit organization dedicated to teaching and practicing iOS development and UI/UX design. As the iOS Bootcamp Team Lead and Chief Learning Officer, 
            I've led efforts to teach over 200 peers to build real-world apps. Additionally, I contribute to the development of the Cupboard app, which helps streamline 
            inventory management for UNC's largest on-campus food pantry, Carolina Cupboard.
          </p>

          <p>
            I further serve the UNC community as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for Systems Fundamentals (COMP 211) and, previously, Computer Organization (COMP 311). I am also a 
            staff member for the Computer Science Experience Labs (CSXL) in Sitterson Hall.

          <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-2 text-justify">Purpose</h1>
          <p>
            My hope in creating this website is to extend my energy from solely CS-related activities to my other interests of equal magnitude â€” namely writing, both philosophically
            and creatively.
